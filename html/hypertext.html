    <h1>HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE</h1><br>
    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the fundamental language used to create and structure web pages.
         It uses a system of elements, represented by tags, to define content such as headings, paragraphs,
          images, links, tables, and forms. HTML provides the basic framework of a webpage, which is then styled 
          using CSS and made interactive with JavaScript. It follows a hierarchical structure, with elements nested 
          within each other to form a well-organized document. Modern HTML (currently HTML5) includes semantic 
          elements like header, article, and footer, which improve accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO). 
        As the backbone of the web, HTML is essential for building any online content.<br>
