    <h1>FRONT-END DEVELOPMENT</h1>
    <p>Techonologies used in front-end development are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="hypertext.html">HTML</a></li>
        <li><a href="css.html">CSS</a></li>
        <li><a href="#section2">JAVASCRIPT</a></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>Front-end development is a crucial aspect of web development that focuses on creating the visual and
         interactive elements of a website or web application. It involves designing user interfaces (UI) and
          ensuring a smooth user experience (UX). Front-end developers use technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
           to build web pages that users interact with directly in their browsers.Front-end development is an exciting and rapidly growing field that plays a vital role in shaping user experiences on the web. It requires a mix of creativity, technical skills, and problem-solving abilities. By mastering front-end technologies and staying updated with industry trends, developers can build visually stunning, responsive, and interactive websites that enhance user engagement..</p>

    <h2 id="section2">Javasript</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a powerful, high-level, dynamic programming language widely used for building interactive and dynamic web applications.
         As one of the core technologies of web development alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript enables client-side scripting, allowing
          developers to create real-time updates, animations, form validations, and interactive user interfaces without requiring a page 
          refresh. It is an object-oriented, prototype-based language with first-class functions, making it highly flexible for both functional
           and event-driven programming paradigms. JavaScript operates within browsers using the Document Object Model (DOM) to manipulate web page elements dynamically, 
           but with the rise of server-side frameworks like Node.js, it has evolved into a full-stack language capable of handling both frontend and backend development. JavaScript supports asynchronous programming through
            callbacks, promises, and async/await, making it ideal for handling API requests and real-time data processing. The language is further enhanced by various libraries (such as jQuery) and frameworks 
            (like React, Angular, and Vue.js) that simplify development and improve efficiency. With continuous advancements, including ES6+ features like arrow functions, template literals, and destructuring,
         JavaScript remains one of the most versatile and essential languages in modern software development.</p><br><br>
